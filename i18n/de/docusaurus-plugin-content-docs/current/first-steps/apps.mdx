## Famedly for desktop

You can use Famedly on your Mac or PC as a downloadable desktop application. Here's what you need to know 🖥️

### Why use the desktop app?

Famedly's desktop app is a clean, distraction-free interface without all the temptation of tabs. You'll receive notifications when something important happens inside Famedly – i.e. someone sends you a message and you see in the app symbol if there are unread chat rooms.

### Install the app

Famedly ships the desktop as a progressive web app. To install the app, please visit https://messenger.famedly.de and watch the video how to install:
