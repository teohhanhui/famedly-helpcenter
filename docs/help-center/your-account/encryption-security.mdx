## Verify devices

Messages are encrypted for each device individually, so you should verify all your own devices to prove that it's not someone else who got hold of your credentials.

If you want to use the end-to-end encryption on every device you need to verify your devices. All messages are encrypted for each device separately. Therefore verification is necessary to ensure the right person is receiving the message.

## Best practices for secure passwords

With the following tips you can increase the security of your passwords considerably without
significant additional expenses. As TI-Messenger supplier we are obligated to point out
these guidelines.  

**General Password Guidelines:**  
<ol>
    <li>Do not reuse passwords</li>
    <li>Avoid passwords that are easy to guess (e.g. 12345678 or your date of birth)</li>
    <li>Use upper and lower case letters, numbers and special characters</li>
    <li>Please use passwords with 12 or more characters (the longer the password the more secure)</li>
    <li>Keep passwords secret</li>
    <li>Unobserved password entry</li>
    <li>Do not use keyboard shortcuts and do not store passwords in your browser</li>
    <li>Passwords should only be noted down for emergencies</li>
    <li>If you note your passwords for emergencies, make sure to keep the note hidden and not close to your workplace (never on the monitor, under the keyboard or in similar places!)</li>
</ol> 

**Password-Manager:** Consider using a password manager  
**Password change:** Change your password immediately if you assume it was stolen
