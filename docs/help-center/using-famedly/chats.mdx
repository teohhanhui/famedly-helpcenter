### Add people to a group

Groups are the best way to keep conversations about various projects, topics or teams organised in Famedly. Add people to groups to bring the right people and information together in one place. You can add an unlimited number of people to a group. The larger the groups become, the more confusing the collaboration can become. We therefore recommend consciously considering which people are added.
   
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="desktop" label="Desktop" default>
  <ol>
    <li>Click on the <b>three dots</b> in the top right corner of a group's screen to open the group details.</li>
    <li>Click on <b>Members</b>.</li>
    <li>Click <b>＋</b> in the upper right corner.</li>
    <li>Click on the person you want to add.</li>
  </ol>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mobile" label="Mobile">

### Remove people from a group

Famedly organises conversations between several people in groups. Groups provide order and clarity for work. Create topic-based groups or groups for teams to encourage collaboration. If a person no longer needs to be part of a group, the person can be removed. Administrators of a group can remove people from the group.

If you remove a person from a group, that person can no longer participate in the communication, but still has access to old messages within the group.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="desktop" label="Desktop" default>
  <ol>
    <li>Click on the <b>three dots</b> in the top right corner of a group's screen to open the group details.</li>
    <li>Click on <b>Members</b>.</li>

## Chat tips and best practices

- Make sure that the group chats you create or maintain have a clear topic and description so that people understand what they’re used for.
- Make your group chats unique by setting up a profile picture for your group chat
- Archive group chats when they’re no longer needed.
