## Why are you here?

Although everyone is talking about artificial intelligence and breathtaking advances in digitalization in medicine, the daily routine of medical professionals seems to be unnoticed. For example, care providers still use the fax machine, information is shared over phones after waiting in a queue for an eternity, and no added value can be drawn from the data that is generated. We want to change that:

Famedly aims to distribute chat-based information within and between care providers in a secure and privacy-compliant manner. This can be a classic chat room between colleagues, but also time-critical processes, e.g. a thrombectomy transfer between clinics.

## What does Famedly mean?

**Fa-med-ly** is a made-up word and the combination of Family and Medicine and was born from the idea of creating a safe and trustworthy communication environment for medical professionals.

## What makes Famedly different from other chat solutions?

Famedly is *the* solution for decentralized networking of the healthcare industry. With the secure digital infrastructure we have developed, we ensure structured and efficient data exchange, seamless intersectoral communication, and enable easy integration of digital services for all healthcare providers.

In particular, the innovative, decentralized structure instead of a centralized, proprietary solution is ideally tailored to the high degree of fragmentation that prevails. Only by giving each facility its own server with Famedly does each organization get absolute sovereignty over its data. And yet, by using innovative encryption algorithms, it is also possible to connect to other institutions in a privacy-compliant, intersectoral manner. The use of open interfaces and standard file formats takes into account the fragmentation in the IT systems used. This is because, compared to other providers, it enables connection to primary systems, digital health solutions and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Extensions to the chat protocol developed by Famedly allow processes to be flexibly mapped digitally and thus made more efficient.
