## Famedly for web

Famedly is a cloud-based app, and you can access it from multiple web browsers - Chrome, Firefox, Safari. As long as you're connected to the web, all of your messages syncs automatically.

### Accessing the web app

To use Famedly in your browser, go to https://messenger.famedly.de and click Log In at the top right corner. If you are an on-premise customer, there is a high chance, that you need to use another link. Please ask your organization.

1. Enter the domain of your instance.
2. Enter your username & password.

### Supported browsers

- We fully support Famedly on Safari, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
- For Firefox users, we recommend using the standard edition of Firefox for the best experience — Developer Edition and Nightly are not fully supported. 
- Unfortunately, Internet Explorer is not supported at this time.

## Famedly for desktop

You can use Famedly on your Mac or PC as a downloadable desktop application. Here's what you need to know.

### Why use the desktop app?

Famedly's desktop app is a clean, distraction-free interface without all the temptation of tabs. You'll receive notifications when something important happens inside Famedly – i.e. someone sends you a message and you see in the app symbol if there are unread chat rooms.

### Install the app

Famedly ships the desktop as a progressive web app. To install the app, please visit https://messenger.famedly.de and watch the video how to install:

</p>

:::info

If you are installing the app using Firefox, there won't be a badge in the app icon to show unread messages.

:::

### Update the app

Famedly updates automatically! We push updates on a regular basis with bug fixes and performance improvements.
- Very rarely, you may need to re-install Famedly to see an update. We'll let you know when that's the case and tell you exactly what to do.
